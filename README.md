# BaseballScoreCenter
Pebble Baseball Client

This is a Pebble smartwatch app that pulls live baseball scores and displays them nicely on the wrist.

##SCServer

For the client that pulls data and sends them to watches in the form of Timeline pins and notifications, see the [SCServer repository](https://github.com/EthanBogart/SCServer).

##Development

To open up the app in a development environment, unfortunately, you must use [CloudPebble](https://cloudpebble.net/ide/). Fortunately, all you have to do is sign up and then import the project.
